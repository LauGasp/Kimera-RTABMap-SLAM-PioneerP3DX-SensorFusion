# Kimera-RTABMap-SLAM-PioneerP3DX-SensorFusion
This repository includes work from my dissertation, involving SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using a Pioneer P3DX robot equipped with a 2D LIDAR, Intel D435i and Mynt Eye sensors. The project integrates these sensors to provide accurate localization and mapping.

## Overview
The primary components and techniques used in this project include:
- **Robot:** Pioneer P3DX
- **Sensors:**
  - **2D LIDAR**
  - **Intel D435i**
  - **Mynt Eye**
