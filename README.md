# Kimera-RTABMap-SLAM-PioneerP3DX-SensorFusion
This repository includes work from my dissertation, involving experimental tests with 3D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) methods using a robot equipped with multiple sensors. 

## Overview
The sensing system used include:
- **Robot:** Pioneer P3DX
- **Sensors:**
  - 2D LIDAR: Hokuyo URG-04L
  - RGBD camera: Intel RealSense D435i
  - Stereo Camera: Mynt Eye S1030
 
**Tools/Packages:**

- **[rtabmap_ros](https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros):** This ROS package provides the RTAB-Map framework for RGB-D SLAM using a global loop closure detector with real-time constraints. It can generate 3D point clouds of the environment and/or create a 2D occupancy grid map for navigation. In this project, it was used as a ground truth (GT) localization estimator.

- **[robot_localization](https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization):** A ROS package for nonlinear state estimation. The `ekf_robot_localization` node integrates data from multiple sensors using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to enhance localization accuracy.

- **[hector_slam](https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_slam):** ROS package optimized for processing 2D LIDAR data and generating detailed 2D maps.

- **[Kimera-VIO-ROS](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-VIO-ROS):** A ROS wrapper for Kimera-VIO, providing Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) para estimar a trajetória de um robô.
  
- **[Kimera-RPGO](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-RPGO):**  Optimizes the pose estimates generated by Kimera-VIO, supporting loop-closure detection and pose-graph optimization.

- **[Kimera-Semantics](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-Semantics):** Real-Time 3D Semantic Reconstruction from 2D data.

- **[Kalibr](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr):** It is the tool used for calibrations, such as visual-inertial and multi-camera calibration. In the context of this project, it was used for the calibration required for SLAM methods, specifically in Kimera.

- **[Allan Variance ROS](https://github.com/ori-drs/allan_variance_ros):** Calculates noise models for inertial sensors

- **[Kimera-Multi](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-Multi):** This repository integrates multiple Kimera components, including Kimera-Semantics, Kimera-VIO, Kimera-Distributed, Kimera-Multi-LCD, Kimera-PGMO, DPGO, and DPGO-ROS. It provides a system designed for multiple robots with a distributed architecture.

- **[mmsegmentation_ros](https://github.com/jianhengLiu/mmsegmentation_ros):** A ROS package that utilizes the [mmsegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) toolbox from OpenMMLab for semantic segmentation. In this case, the PSPNet network was used for detailed semantic segmentation.



## Setup and Usage

### 1. Launching the Robot and Sensors

To launch the robot platform and the selected sensors, use the `catkin_pioneer` workspace. This command initializes the robot, the D435i camera, and the 2D LIDAR:


```
cd catkin_pioneer/
catkin_build
source devel/setup.bash
cd src/Pioneer_P3_DX2_packages_ROS_Noetic/Pioneer_P3_DX2_packages_ROS_Noetic/robot/launch
roslaunch robot robot.launch 
```

The Mynt Eye sensor requires ROS Melodic. To set up the Mynt Eye sensor, use Docker to install the Mynt Eye SDK drivers. Run the following commands to start the Docker container for the Mynt Eye SDK:
```
cd mynteye_docker/docker
docker compose up
```
### 2. Docker Setup for RTAB-Map and Robot localization 

The RTAB-Map setup is managed via Docker to handle dependencies and configurations. To start the RTAB-Map Docker container, use:

```
cd rtabmap_docker/docker
docker compose up
```

This command launches RTAB-Map with additional parameters and manages the odometry fusion. Specifically, it starts the `rtabmap_odom node`, `rtabmap_slam node`, `imu_filter_node` and `ekf_localization_node`.

### 3. Hector SLAM for 2D LIDAR

For processing 2D LIDAR data with Hector SLAM, a script named `pose_to_odom_hectorslam.py` is available in the `/Other_code` directory. This script converts odometry data to pose and serves as input for robot localization package.

To run Hector SLAM, use:
```
roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch
```

### 4. Kimera


This project involves testing several Kimera algorithms, including Kimera-VIO, Kimera-RPGO, and Kimera-Semantics. Kimera-Semantics requires odometry data and a neural network for segmentation. The mmsegmentation_ros package is adapted for class filtering and is based on mmsegmentation with the PSPNet network.
Kimera-Semantics is fed with data from Kimera-VIO/RPGO and RTAB-Map to achieve superior results.
